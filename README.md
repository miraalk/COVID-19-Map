# COVID-19 Map

Web-based map showing confirmed cases, potential cases and vulnerable populations in Canada based on publicly available data and data from [flatten.ca](flatten.ca).

## Important Details

- The repository contains two components a webpage and background scripts contained in the `\website` and `\data_generator_scripts` directories.
- Any changes to the stagging branch are automatically pushed to https://flatten-staging-271921.web.app/. Any changes to master are automatically pushed to https://flatten.ca.
- **All contributions should be made on a new branch and a pull request to *staging* should be made.**
- **Use  the Issues tabs to keep track of bugs, improvements and more. Use the Projects tab to keep track of work!**

## Prerequisites

For front-end:
- A web browser.
- The firebase command line interface (CLI).
  - Available [https://firebase.google.com/docs/cli#install_the_firebase_cli](here).

For back-end:
- [Python 3.5+](https://www.python.org/)

## Setting up

Front-end:

1. Ask Martin to create you a flatten Google account and give you read permissions to the storage.

2. If you were already logged in run `firebase logout` then `firebase login`. Use your newly generated Google account.

3. Create two new files in the root directory called `firebase.json` and `.firebasec`. They should have the same contents as `deployment/firebase.staging.json` and `deployment/.firebasec.staging`. Do not commit these files (they should be automatically ignored).

Back-end:

As mentionned here: https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/production?hl=en_GB. A service account needs to be created (ask Martin or Arthur) and then environment variables need to be set. Follow tutorials.

Install the following Python libraries: `pip install --upgrade google-api-python-client google-auth-httplib2 google-auth-oauthlib google-cloud-storage google-cloud-datastore`

## Running the app

Front-end

- Run `firebase serve` and go to the indicated URL (usually `localhost:5000`)!

Back-end

- Run the Python script.

## Internal Notes

### Format for form data

**`form_data.js`**

```
{
            "total_responses" : 6969, # total number of reports recieved
            "max" : 9992,
            "time" : 29483929829, # UTC unix timestamp in ms since the origin
            "fsa" : {
                "B1A" : {"number_reports": 4938, "pot": 23, "risk": 18},
                .
                .
                .
    }
} 
```
`confirmed.json`

```
{
    "last_updated" : "Date accessed at: 23/03/2020...",
    "max_cases" : 230,
    "confirmed_cases": [
        {
            "name" : "Algoma, Ontario",
            "cases" : 1,
            "coord" : [44.289, -79.8536]
        },
        {
            "name" : "Bas-Saint-Laurent, Quebec",
            "cases" : 2,
            "coord" : [48.30, 23.4]
        }
    ]
}
```


### Setting up Firebase Storage for the first time

This only needs to be done once per project, so don't worry about it.

To allow the frontend of the map to read from the cloud storage buckets (storing the data), you will need to set the origin policy to allow reading of the cloud storage buckets. Add the following to a file called cors.json:
```
    [
      {
    "origin": ["*"],
    "method": ["GET"],
    "maxAgeSeconds": 3600
  }
]
```
then run 
```gsutil cors set cors.json gs://flatten-staging-271921.appspot.com```

You need to ensure that the firebase rules on the bucket are set up to allow reading of the files externally.


### Deploying on Cloud Build

Everything should work more or less out of the box, apart from the fact that you have to set the `_BRANCH` envoronment variable to `prod` for prouduction or `dev` for development.


### Deploying the cloud functions

You will need to set the appropriate environment variables for each.

For form_data_generator, these are
* GCS_BUCKET, should point to that which to upload the data
* UPLOAD_FILE, the name of the file to upload the confirmed cases data to
* DS_NAMEPSACE, datastore namespaace to get the data from
* DS_KIND, the datastore kind to load data from

For `confirmed_cases`, they are:
* SPREADSHEET_ID, should (at the moment) be 
* GCS_BUCKET, should point to that which to upload the data
* UPLOAD_FILE, the name of the file to upload the confirmed cases data to
* SHEETS_API_KEY, API key for google sheets.
